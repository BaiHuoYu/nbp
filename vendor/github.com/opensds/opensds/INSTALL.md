This installation document assumes that you use [CEPH](https://github.com/ceph/ceph) as the default driver,and use the [ETCD](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) as the default database.So,
before you start up the OpenSDS,the ceph cluster and etcd should be start up firstly.Then you can excute the followings step by step.

* Download the OpenSDS source code and change it to the development branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensds/opensds.git -b development
```

* Install the ceph driver dependent packet.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y librados-dev librbd-dev
```

* Enter the source code directory and build the source code.

```bash
root@opensds-worker-1:~# cd opensds/
root@opensds-worker-1:~/opensds# make
go get github.com/opensds/opensds/cmd/osdslet
go get github.com/opensds/opensds/cmd/osdsdock
mkdir -p  ./build/out/bin/
go build -o ./build/out/bin/osdsdock github.com/opensds/opensds/cmd/osdsdock
mkdir -p  ./build/out/bin/
go build -o ./build/out/bin/osdslet github.com/opensds/opensds/cmd/osdslet
```
* The binary file will be generated to 

```
./build/out/bin
```
* Config the configuration file, you can refer to the following configuration

```
[osdsdock]
enabled_backends = ceph
ceph_config = /etc/opensds/driver/ceph.yaml

[ceph]
name = ceph
description = Ceph Test
endpoint = 127.0.0.1
driver_name = ceph
```
If you want to test ceph driver,you should config the ```/etc/opensds/driver/ceph.yaml``` too, you can refer to the following configuration

```
configFile: /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
pool:
  "rbd":
    diskType: SSD
    iops: 1000
    bandWitdh: 1G
```

* Start up the osdslet and osdsdock. 

```bash
./osdslet

./osdsock
```
* Test the OpenSDS if it is work well by getting the api versions and the ceph storage pools.
